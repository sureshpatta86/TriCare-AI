# Profile Auto-Population Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented auto-population of profile data (age, sex, postal_code) across multiple pages to improve user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Page - Postal Code Field Added
**File**: `frontend/src/app/profile/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `postal_code` to formData state initialization
- ✅ Added `postal_code` to useEffect population from user data
- ✅ Fixed Cancel button to include `postal_code` in reset
- ✅ Added UI field for postal code in Personal Information section (between phone and blood type)
- ✅ Imported `MapPin` icon from lucide-react

**UI Layout**:
```
Personal Information:
- Row 1: Age | Sex | Blood Type (3 columns)
- Row 2: Phone Number | Postal Code (2 columns)
```

---

### 2. Symptoms Page - Auto-populate Age & Sex
**File**: `frontend/src/app/symptoms/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Imported `useAuth` hook and `useEffect` from React
- ✅ Added `user` from `useAuth()` context
- ✅ Added `setValue` to useForm destructuring
- ✅ Created useEffect to auto-populate age and gender from user profile
- ✅ Mapped profile sex values (Male/Female/Other) to form values (male/female/other)

**Code**:
```typescript
// Auto-populate age and sex from user profile
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    if (user.age) {
      setValue('age', user.age);
    }
    if (user.sex) {
      const genderMap: Record<string, 'male' | 'female' | 'other'> = {
        'Male': 'male',
        'Female': 'female',
        'Other': 'other'
      };
      const mappedGender = genderMap[user.sex];
      if (mappedGender) {
        setValue('gender', mappedGender);
      }
    }
  }
}, [user, setValue]);
```

**User Experience**: When users visit the symptoms page, age and sex fields are pre-filled from their profile. They can still edit if needed.

### 3. Doctors Page - Auto-populate Postal Code
**File**: `frontend/src/app/doctors/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added useEffect to auto-populate pincode from user.postal_code
- ✅ Only populates if user has postal_code and pincode is empty

**Code**:
```typescript
// Auto-populate postal code from user profile
useEffect(() => {
  if (user?.postal_code && !pincode) {
    setPincode(user.postal_code);
  }
}, [user, pincode]);
```

**User Experience**: When users visit the doctor finder page, the postal code field is pre-filled from their profile. They can still edit if needed.

---

### 4. Backend - Postal Code Column Added
**File**: `backend/app/models/user.py`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `postal_code = Column(String, nullable=True)` to User model
- ✅ Added comment: "# ZIP/Postal code for doctor search"
- ✅ Column positioned after phone field

**Database**:
- ✅ Column automatically created in SQLite database (tricare.db)
- ✅ Verified with migration script that column exists
- ✅ All existing user data preserved

---

### 5. Frontend Types - Postal Code Type Added
**File**: `frontend/src/types/auth.ts`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `postal_code?: string` to User interface
- ✅ Positioned after phone field for consistency

---

### 6. Database Migration Script
**File**: `backend/add_postal_code_migration.py`

**Purpose**: 
- Safely add postal_code column to existing database
- Check if column already exists before adding
- Provide clear output and error handling

**Status**: 
- ✅ Script created and tested
- ✅ Confirmed postal_code column exists in database
- ✅ No migration needed (column auto-created by SQLAlchemy)

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Profile Page**:
   - ✅ Navigate to `/profile`
   - ✅ Click Edit Profile
   - ✅ Fill in postal code (e.g., "12345")
   - ✅ Click Save Profile
   - ✅ Verify postal code is saved and displayed

2. **Symptoms Page**:
   - ✅ Ensure profile has age and sex saved
   - ✅ Navigate to `/symptoms`
   - ✅ Verify age and sex fields are pre-filled
   - ✅ User can still edit if needed

3. **Doctors Page**:
   - ✅ Ensure profile has postal_code saved
   - ✅ Navigate to `/doctors`
   - ✅ Verify postal code field is pre-filled
   - ✅ User can still edit if needed

### Database Verification:
```bash
cd backend
python3 add_postal_code_migration.py
```

Output confirms:
```
✓ postal_code column already exists in users table
Current users table columns: id, email, username, hashed_password, full_name, 
age, sex, phone, blood_type, allergies, chronic_conditions, current_medications, 
emergency_contact, is_active, is_verified, created_at, updated_at, last_login, 
postal_code
```

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: 
   - Users don't need to re-enter information they've already provided
   - Reduces friction when using symptoms checker or doctor finder

2. **Data Consistency**: 
   - Profile becomes single source of truth for user demographic data
   - Encourages users to keep profile up-to-date

3. **Time Savings**: 
   - Faster to get symptom analysis or find doctors
   - Less typing required

4. **Flexibility Maintained**: 
   - All auto-populated fields remain editable
   - Users can override values if needed (e.g., searching for doctors in a different location)
