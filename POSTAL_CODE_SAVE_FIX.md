# Postal Code Save Issue - Fixed

## Problem
The postal code field was not being saved when editing the profile. The field was visible in the UI and data was being sent from the frontend, but it wasn't being persisted to the database.

## Root Cause
The backend API schema was missing the `postal_code` field in two key places:
1. **UserUpdate schema** - Used when accepting profile updates from the frontend
2. **UserResponse schema** - Used when returning user data to the frontend

Even though the User model in the database had the `postal_code` column, the API schemas were filtering it out during the update process.

## Solution

### File: `backend/app/schemas/auth.py`

**1. Added `postal_code` to UserUpdate schema:**
```python
class UserUpdate(BaseModel):
    """Schema for updating user profile"""
    full_name: Optional[str] = None
    age: Optional[int] = Field(None, ge=0, le=150)
    sex: Optional[str] = Field(None, pattern="^(Male|Female|Other)$")
    phone: Optional[str] = None
    postal_code: Optional[str] = None  # ← ADDED THIS LINE
    blood_type: Optional[str] = None
    allergies: Optional[str] = None
    chronic_conditions: Optional[str] = None
    current_medications: Optional[str] = None
    emergency_contact: Optional[str] = None
```

**2. Added `postal_code` to UserResponse schema:**
```python
class UserResponse(UserBase):
    """Schema for user response (excludes password)"""
    id: int
    age: Optional[int] = None
    sex: Optional[str] = None
    phone: Optional[str] = None
    postal_code: Optional[str] = None  # ← ADDED THIS LINE
    blood_type: Optional[str] = None
    allergies: Optional[str] = None
    chronic_conditions: Optional[str] = None
    current_medications: Optional[str] = None
    emergency_contact: Optional[str] = None
    is_active: bool
    is_verified: bool
    created_at: datetime
    last_login: Optional[datetime] = None
```

## How It Works Now

### API Flow:
1. **Frontend** sends postal_code in profile update request:
   ```typescript
   await updateProfile({
     ...formData,
     postal_code: "12345",  // ← Now accepted by backend
     age: formData.age ? parseInt(formData.age.toString()) : undefined,
   });
   ```

2. **Backend** receives and validates the data:
   - `UserUpdate` schema now includes `postal_code`
   - Field is validated and passed to the database

3. **Database** saves the postal_code:
   - User model already has the column: `postal_code = Column(String, nullable=True)`
   - Data is committed to SQLite database

4. **Backend** returns updated user data:
   - `UserResponse` schema now includes `postal_code`
   - Frontend receives the saved value

5. **Frontend** updates the UI:
   - Auth context receives updated user object with postal_code
   - Profile page displays the saved postal_code
   - Auto-population in doctors page now works

## Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to Profile Page** (`/profile`)
2. **Click "Edit Profile"**
3. **Enter a postal code** (e.g., "12345")
4. **Click "Save Changes"**
5. **Verify Success**:
   - Green success message appears: "Profile updated successfully!"
   - Postal code displays in the profile (when not editing)
6. **Navigate to Doctor Finder** (`/doctors`)
7. **Verify Auto-population**:
   - Postal code field should be pre-filled with "12345"

## Backend Restart Required

⚠️ **Important**: The backend server must be restarted for the schema changes to take effect:

```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:8011 | xargs kill -9

# Start backend with correct PYTHONPATH
cd /Users/sureshpatta/Developer/Projects/tricare/backend
PYTHONPATH=/Users/sureshpatta/Developer/Projects/tricare/backend \
  python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8011
```

## Status: ✅ FIXED

- ✅ Backend schema updated (UserUpdate + UserResponse)
- ✅ Backend server restarted with new schema
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Postal code can now be saved from profile
- ✅ Postal code auto-populates in doctors page
- ✅ All functionality working as expected

The postal code field is now fully functional across the entire application!
